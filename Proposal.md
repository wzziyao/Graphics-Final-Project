## Project title/idea
A mini game created using Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), a cross-platform library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components. The process will include setting up SDL from scratch, animating sprites, and applying textures. 


## How will this project be unique from existing demos
Users will be able to play the mini game using both mouse and keyboard.


## Features and timeline
- Minimum required
  - Create a game window
  - Animate sprites
  - Allow the character in the mini game to move around
- Good-to-have
  - Implement tilemap
- Stretch
  - Make the camera follow the character


## Algorithms, data structures and background math
Main.cpp:

```
while (game is running) {
    handle any user input;
    update all variables;
    render changes to display in the window;
}
```

(Will add more details soon)
